# Electrum-ABC-Build-Tools
Windows and other binaries downloaded by the Electron Cash build scripts as part of the build process

We needed to create this repository (which basically hosts binary files) because the SourceForge URLs we initially used to download dependent Wine binaries was unstable/ever-changing/unreliable.

So instead we will download from here in our ElectrumABC wine build scripts.

This repository also hosts tor binaries that users can download from the GUI to enable CashFusion.

Note that this repository is empty.  Instead we rely on the 'Releases' link on github for downloading binaries from here.
